To Do:


Blocks:
I would suggest looking into the CMS complications before code any more blocks.

	- Finish off styling on blocks that I've created already
		- Sound blocks:
			- revise iconography; its shit. consider white outline + animation
	- Add additional blocks: php, js , styling etc.
		Addition blocks:
			- A merch block. Image & copy + link to 3rd party if required. Design > Code
	
- Release

	- create image for the white / small disc - including the sticker etc - how when it moves?

- Add php templates for each of the releases
- Add all releases: i.e content for each; cover image, disc etc.
- Review styling of events page - improvements on Mobile and Desktop?
- add pulsation to player toggle icon, if the player is playing - ensure as many signifiers as possible; such as when the track changes - like a blink or something
- Disc hover state still sometimes incorrect - on news single page for example
- fine tune the player - the icons; the alligment.
- fine tune the player - can we implement a head room on te black bg + the player elments only - not nav buttons.
- fint tune the player - click on the title should probaly take the use to that page (and not soundcloud)
- Release page: the list view: Adress this - it feel gittery because of it snap to 100vh per list itme. What improvements to make?
- Release page vs the player - overlap of design elements. Resolve
- Transition from artist single (will miles for example) to release, the disc image are blown up; visually looks shite. probably need to constrain sizes of the dics markup or similar - 
- Is there a glitch with my carousel sizing on the release page? - Coming from other pages (events) it was too big & a screen resize didn't seem to resolve the issue.
- Should there be a more seemles transition between the artist archive archive page and artist posts, in terms of the bg image blur & remaining loading. Or is that and old design idea? 

- when adding headroom - could maybe the nav icon blur instead? as per some of my older design reference/ideas in Sketch 
- Devise a design & coding solution for digital release. How do we animate them, as we can't use rolling vinyl discs.
- Check my whole site on a touch devices. What are the current dev issues: hover states etc? Check player!

All this to be designed (& sourced/write the copy) & Coded.

What to do?

Use of blocks only? But how. < look at the designs. Whats the best way to achieve this?


Tidy up To Do's:

- go through all files and adress current comments. Ensure everything is resolve.
- Tidy up the formatting of my markup; make it "clean" as fuck.


WP CMS:

- how do I improve the UI so that we're able to see more accurately what layout is being created:
enqueing up admin styles and js basically; but how to enque + & also best practice for writing code for use within the CMS?
-- Go through the functions & ACF CMS - ensure no reference to previious iuse of code & asign correct instructions accordingluy



SKETCH:

Tidy up my files! Make it prestenable; see it more as a way of showing design work aswell




LIVE SITE:
