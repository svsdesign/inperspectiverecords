PAGES TO add

	- GDPR & Cookies

	This allows you to check: 2GDPR - https://2gdpr.com/ - not svs.design :(
	- https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/WEBGUIDE/04.+Cookies#section_4 < EU "cookie kit - for info i think"

	I think / wonder if i need to ensure certain cookies can be blocked based on a users' preferences. Ensure the plugin choosen does this.

	WP solutions

		DONT USE:

		- GDPR Cookie Consent: https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info
		- https://www.onetrust.com/
		- https://www.cookiebot.com/en/ - With this we are looking at Â£8p/m
		- https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-cookie-law/ < this seems interesting 
		- https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/ < this has over a milliion installs. + seemingly a lot of options, but not tested on the version of WP that the local inp is running on (and probably not on the live version either)

		MAYBE USE:

		- Klaro Consent Manager: https://wordpress.org/plugins/klaro-consent-manager/  -  Free + Open Source
	
	JS solutions:
		I reckon JS solutions is best route to down:
