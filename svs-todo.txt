To Do:


STAGING

Make sure this setup, so we can savely push updates live


- Home page

 - finish coding designs
 

- Artists

	- Disc hover state still sometimes incorrect - on news single page & artists for example

- Events 
	
	- Review styling of events page - improvements on Mobile and Desktop?


- Radio / Player

 
 	- fine tune the player on the archive page - the icons; the alligment.
 	- fine tune the player - click on the title should probaly take the use to that page (and not soundcloud)


- Releases

	- Add php templates for each of the releases
	- Add all releases: i.e content for each; cover image, disc etc.
	- create image for the white / small disc - including the sticker etc - how when it moves?
	- Devise a design & coding solution for digital release. How do we animate them, as we can't use rolling vinyl discs.


SEO + "rich" web search / sharing
	- what measure / changes to ensure good meta data is supplied


Glitches + bugs

	- Transition from artist single (will miles for example) to release, the disc image are blown up; visually looks shite. probably need to constrain sizes of the dics markup or similar - 
	- Is there a glitch with my carousel sizing on the release page? - Coming from other pages (events) it was too big & a screen resize didn't seem to resolve the issue.
	- Should there be a more seemles transition between the artist archive archive page and artist posts, in terms of the bg image blur & remaining loading. Or is that and old design idea? 
	- Check my whole site on a touch devices. What are the current dev issues: hover states etc? Check player!


PAGES TO add

	- GDPR & Cookies

	This allows you to check: 2GDPR - https://2gdpr.com/ - not svs.design :(
	- https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/WEBGUIDE/04.+Cookies#section_4 < EU "cookie kit - for info i think"

	I think / wonder if i need to ensure certain cookies can be blocked based on a users' preferences. Ensure the plugin choosen does this.

	WP solutions

		- https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-cookie-law/ < this seems interesting 
		- https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/ < this has over a milliion installs. + seemingly a lot of options, but not tested on the version of WP that the local inp is running on (and probably not on the live version either)

- Blocks:

	I would suggest looking into the CMS complications before code any more blocks.

	- Finish off styling on blocks that I've created already
		- Sound blocks:
			- revise iconography; its shit. consider white outline + animation
	- Add additional blocks: php, js , styling etc.
		Addition blocks:
			- A merch block. Image & copy + link to 3rd party if required. Design > Code

- go through all files and adress current comments. Ensure everything is resolve.
- Tidy up the formatting of my markup; make it "clean" as fuck.


WP CMS:

- how do I improve the UI so that we're able to see more accurately what layout is being created:
enqueing up admin styles and js basically; but how to enque + & also best practice for writing code for use within the CMS?
-- Go through the functions & ACF CMS - ensure no reference to previious iuse of code & asign correct instructions accordingluy
